  talk: "Five Tips for Aspiring Tech Team Managers"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Management isn't a topic that developers like to discuss a lot, it simply isn't as exciting as single responsibility or interface segregation. It is though a very important topic as management can make or break a tech project. It is aslo an interesting and worthwhile career path for people to follow; learning to mentor and guide younger developers along with learning about the business, finance and legal side of tech projects. <br /><br />
    Transitioning from developer to manager can be difficult though, in my talk I will offer advice for aspiring managers and developers generally on why they should become managers, what to expect and how to become better at it."

  talk: "Introduction to PHP Extensions"
  synopsis:
    "<br />In this presentation, we take a first look at writing PHP extensions. Using step-by-step examples, we'll take a function written in PHP and convert them into a loadable extension using C. We'll then test both versions and compare the results. After seeing the size and scope of the benefits that can be realized with only a few minor changes, you'll want to try it out for yourself. You'll also understand why we start with simple things, and not try to rewrite all of Symfony in C. <br /><br />"

  talk: "Graphs are Everywhere"
  synopsis:
    "<br />No - not charts! Graphs are a data structure that are more than just the nodes and edges they contain: from mapping networks to representing arithmetic, from writing chat-bots to inferring relationships, applying graphs to a problem can quite often provide an elegant solution.  <br /><br />
    In this light-hearted and accessible talk, Chris will cover the basics of graphs as well as go over a few simple but fun examples of this versatile concept. <br /><br />"

  talk: "An Introduction to Lean and Functional Domain Modelling"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Rich domain models, inspired by imperative objective-oriented approaches, dominate our industry. But lean domain models are a compelling alternative. <br /><br />
    By separating behaviour and state, lean models offer an effective way to represent units of behaviour. This session will explore how to represent a lean domain model using a functional programming paradigm. <br /><br />
    We'll explore how types can be used as a natural way to represent business constraints alongside smart constructors and functional validation. How behaviour can be better composed, and how to keep domain behaviour isolated from application state. <br /><br />"

    n this session we will explore programming as a modelling activity comparing it with art and science: exploring the relationship between programming and truth, knowledge and representation. <br /><br />
    I'll speak in terms of PHP examples possibly also in comparison to other languages. <br /><br />"

  talk: "Functional Programming in PHP"
  synopsis:
    "<br />It's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the term 'Functional Programming' while reading online discussions about programming languages or programming in general. People discussing FP routinely use terms that can be strange and unfamiliar to developers coming from the imperative/OO world.   <br /><br />
    What exactly is Functional Programming? Where does it come from? How does it differ from the programming I know?  <br /><br />
    This talk will try to answer these questions by weaving seemingly unrelated concepts into a (hopefully) coherent story of FP, using PHP as the vehicle of expressing these ideas. The side effect (pun intended) of having a basic grasp of FP will make you a better developer, which will make you a better PHP developer. <br /><br />"

    If you find it easier to understand abstract concepts like these by implementing them, then you're in luck because in this talk we'll create a simple HTTP server, then develop an event loop and finally create a simple Promise class. Once we're done, we'll have all the tools at our disposal to make our PHP applications as performant as NodeJs ones!"

  talk: "Grown-up MongoDB: Schema Design"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Although MongoDB is a non-relational database, it is still very important that you store your data in an optimal way. This presentation make you grow up from just starting with MongoDB, to a seasoned user, by teaching you how to design your data schema according to your application's needs. This requires a different mind set than designing for a relational database. <br /><br />

    Besides schema design techniques, I will also cover how to pick indexes, different types of indexes, and way to find out why queries are potentially not as fast as they could be."

  talk: "Getting started with Test-Driven Laravel"
  synopsis:
    <br />"Amo was recently asked by a developer who is new to the Laravel framework, and the PHP language in general, where they should begin with her first project using the framework. <br /><br />

    'Should I define all of my routes up-front?' <br /><br />

    'How about I start with my views? But then, how will I render them? Maybe I need controllers first?' <br /><br />

    'Perhaps I should figure out which models I'll need and go from there?' <br /><br />

    The conversion reminded Amo of when he first begun adopting test-driven development in projects. It can seem overwhelming at first, especially as there's no simple 'how-to' guide or industry standard methodology to take you through an entire feature's lifecycle. <br />

    Fortunately, Laravel not only makes it easy to get started, but to use a test-driven approach which guides your application's development. <br /><br />

    Test-driven development, or TDD often divides opinions within the PHP community. Some of the common comments I often hear from developers, who have not adopted TDD are, 'My boss would never allow more time for testing', 'It takes too long to write tests', 'It's too difficult to learn how to test'.<br /><br />

    This talk aims to highlight some of the benefits of how TDD with Laravel can drive your application's design, and improve your code, without needing additional time commitment."

  talk: "How I built a commercial side project, on the Tube"
  synopsis:
    "Join Rik Heywood as he will be talking about a side project that he has been working on the last few years, called Team Absence (https://teamabsence.com). It is a PHP 7, Laravel 5.2 project that he has built almost entirely on the tube during his daily commute.

    He will be talking through the process of building this project, which has variously been a playground for him to try out new ideas, a fun way to spend his time, or a way to teach himself about new versions of Laravel before subjecting his team to the change.

    It's only recently turned into an actual serious attempt to ship something, so he also wants to talk about what had to change to make that possible.

    Finally, building something real in 30 minute bursts, in a cramped and noise environment has it's own challenges. He'd love people to walk away at the end of the talk believing that, yes, they can try and build that great idea in the back of their head - it can be done."

  talk: "Shipping Faster With Storyplayer"
  synopsis:
    "In the Autumn of 2015, Stuart took on a project to upgrade a payment system - and to deliver it in time for Christmas. He had to build out the new features for a code base he'd never worked on before, which relied heavily on manual testing, with a team who were new to Zend Framework 2. Oh, and he had to do this whilst the original authors of the gateway continued to work on it too - and their work had priority over his.

    What was the secret ingredient that made this possible? Storyplayer, the open-source functional test tool.

    In this talk, Stuart will tell what he can of this recent war story, and show you how his team shipped faster by using Storyplayer. He'll share with you what worked, what didn't, and how you can ship faster too."

    "Efficient and performant applications are fantastic; they keep server load, costs and response times low. We can make our web applications more efficient by removing the repetitive bootstrapping process from the request-response cycle.

    How? I hear you ask!

    By using FastCGI we can keep our application alive between requests and vastly improve their performance. The best news is that if you're using a Request-Response framework (such as Symfony) you can easily do this by integrating a simple bundle."

  synopsis:
    "During this talk I will give you a guide from a developers perspective of getting code running on Googles container platform Kubernetes. This is a platform we are in progress of migrating to at the Home Office, and this talk will focus on my experiences using it.

    Kubernetes is an open source PaaS platform that you can run internally in your company or run on Google's servers. It's based on Docker, and can manage replication, load balancing and resilience built in. 

    I'm going to guide you through getting your code running on it, including how to create your own docker containers and best practices for doing so. I'm then going to show you how to get those containers running on Kubernetes. I'll also show you how to wire multiple containers together, and discuss how to manage resilience.

    This talk is aimed at developers of all skill levels, and doesn't focus on any particular language. DevOps people who are interested in Kubernetes will also get an overview of the platform, and I will touch on issues such as data replication between nodes."
