  talk: "Real world deployments - Empowering developers, delivering features"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Real world deployments - Enabling engineers to ship code to users quickly and safely is an incredibly empowering and motivating thing, encouraging quick iteration, collaboration, and solving real world problems for users. <br /><br />

    At busuu we've worked hard to get our deployment and automation tooling to a place where any engineer can deploy any branch to any environment quickly and safely, and roll back if there are any issues. <br /><br />

    I\'ll talk through why we focus on this, how it has impacted on our team, and some real world examples of how we\'ve implemented deployments in our team."

  talk: "Event Driven Architecture"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Have you ever wondered what ReactPHP meant by 'non blocking I/O'? Or why would being 'event-driven' allow nginx to be more efficient than Apache? <br /><br />

    If you find it easier to understand abstract concepts like these by implementing them, then you're in luck because in this talk we'll create a simple HTTP server, then develop an event loop and finally create a simple Promise class. Once we're done, we'll have all the tools at our disposal to make our PHP applications as performant as NodeJs ones!"

  talk: "Grown-up MongoDB: Schema Design"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Although MongoDB is a non-relational database, it is still very important that you store your data in an optimal way. This presentation make you grow up from just starting with MongoDB, to a seasoned user, by teaching you how to design your data schema according to your application's needs. This requires a different mind set than designing for a relational database. <br /><br />

    Besides schema design techniques, I will also cover how to pick indexes, different types of indexes, and way to find out why queries are potentially not as fast as they could be."

  talk: "Getting started with Test-Driven Laravel"
  synopsis:
    <br />"Amo was recently asked by a developer who is new to the Laravel framework, and the PHP language in general, where they should begin with her first project using the framework. <br /><br />

    'Should I define all of my routes up-front?' <br /><br />

    'How about I start with my views? But then, how will I render them? Maybe I need controllers first?' <br /><br />

    'Perhaps I should figure out which models I'll need and go from there?' <br /><br />

    The conversion reminded Amo of when he first begun adopting test-driven development in projects. It can seem overwhelming at first, especially as there's no simple 'how-to' guide or industry standard methodology to take you through an entire feature's lifecycle. <br />

    Fortunately, Laravel not only makes it easy to get started, but to use a test-driven approach which guides your application's development. <br /><br />

    Test-driven development, or TDD often divides opinions within the PHP community. Some of the common comments I often hear from developers, who have not adopted TDD are, 'My boss would never allow more time for testing', 'It takes too long to write tests', 'It's too difficult to learn how to test'.<br /><br />

    This talk aims to highlight some of the benefits of how TDD with Laravel can drive your application's design, and improve your code, without needing additional time commitment."

  talk: "Docker in Production"
  synopsis:
    "Docker - the awesome utility that allows you to create a single, runnable, distributable application... but is it really that awesome?

    In this talk David will discuss some of the common pitfalls and hurdles that one must navigate to have an enjoyable and fruitful relationship with Docker; giving you the confidence to take that relationship to the next stage: production."

  talk: "How I built a commercial side project, on the Tube"
  synopsis:
    "Join Rik Heywood as he will be talking about a side project that he has been working on the last few years, called Team Absence (https://teamabsence.com). It is a PHP 7, Laravel 5.2 project that he has built almost entirely on the tube during his daily commute.

    He will be talking through the process of building this project, which has variously been a playground for him to try out new ideas, a fun way to spend his time, or a way to teach himself about new versions of Laravel before subjecting his team to the change.

    It's only recently turned into an actual serious attempt to ship something, so he also wants to talk about what had to change to make that possible.

    Finally, building something real in 30 minute bursts, in a cramped and noise environment has it's own challenges. He'd love people to walk away at the end of the talk believing that, yes, they can try and build that great idea in the back of their head - it can be done."

  talk: "Shipping Faster With Storyplayer"
  synopsis:
    "In the Autumn of 2015, Stuart took on a project to upgrade a payment system - and to deliver it in time for Christmas. He had to build out the new features for a code base he'd never worked on before, which relied heavily on manual testing, with a team who were new to Zend Framework 2. Oh, and he had to do this whilst the original authors of the gateway continued to work on it too - and their work had priority over his.

    What was the secret ingredient that made this possible? Storyplayer, the open-source functional test tool.

    In this talk, Stuart will tell what he can of this recent war story, and show you how his team shipped faster by using Storyplayer. He'll share with you what worked, what didn't, and how you can ship faster too."

  talk: "Dockerizing your CI/CD pipelines"
  synopsis:
    "This talk is intermediate level and should have a bit of something for everyone whether youâ€™re building a standard pipeline (non-docker) or already have a pipeline and looking to see how docker will make it even stronger.

    I will demonstrate how building pipelines with Docker differs from traditional pipelines, what steps are involved in migrating from traditional pipelines to docker ones. I will share my experiences, tips & tricks, lessons learned on my journey into Docker land."

  talk: "Imposter Syndrome: Am I Faking It?"
  synopsis:
    "Do you feel like you're faking it? like you don't feel good enough to do your job? Feeling like you've blagged your way through your career? Then like me and hundreds of others, you might be suffering from imposter syndrome. During my talk I am going to discuss what imposter syndrome is and how it feels. Then I'm going to talk you through why people suffer from it and how people overcome it. 

    This talk is based on both my personal experiences and those of others. By the end of it I hope you can identify if you are suffering from imposter syndrome and also create a team environment that helps to combat the feeling within your team mates."

  talk: "Breaking boundaries with FastCGI"
  synopsis:
    "Efficient and performant applications are fantastic; they keep server load, costs and response times low. We can make our web applications more efficient by removing the repetitive bootstrapping process from the request-response cycle.

    How? I hear you ask!

    By using FastCGI we can keep our application alive between requests and vastly improve their performance. The best news is that if you're using a Request-Response framework (such as Symfony) you can easily do this by integrating a simple bundle."

  talk: "Kubernetes"
  synopsis:
    "During this talk I will give you a guide from a developers perspective of getting code running on Googles container platform Kubernetes. This is a platform we are in progress of migrating to at the Home Office, and this talk will focus on my experiences using it.

    Kubernetes is an open source PaaS platform that you can run internally in your company or run on Google's servers. It's based on Docker, and can manage replication, load balancing and resilience built in. 

    I'm going to guide you through getting your code running on it, including how to create your own docker containers and best practices for doing so. I'm then going to show you how to get those containers running on Kubernetes. I'll also show you how to wire multiple containers together, and discuss how to manage resilience.

    This talk is aimed at developers of all skill levels, and doesn't focus on any particular language. DevOps people who are interested in Kubernetes will also get an overview of the platform, and I will touch on issues such as data replication between nodes."
