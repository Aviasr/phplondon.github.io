bio: >
  After tinkering with a PC at the age of four, Sebastian was hooked. 14 years later his code made it on the Internet when he discovered PHP. Since this time there is always some project which needs work done, whether it's a small bash script or a weekend project. Since discovering github, Sebastian is also a contributor to some OOS projects.

  At work, Sebastian tries to stay sane by applying agile methodology and ideas from the lean startup movement while pretending to be a project manager. In his free time he either talks about vagrant (a lot) or tries to convince people to join ViennaPHP, the PHP Usergroup he founded and organizes.
