  <a href="https://twitter.com/BillieAThompson">Billie Thompson</a> is a contracting software developer. She's been
  contracting from her own company Purple Booth Ltd for two and a quarter years, but has been working in developing
  software for over six years.

  During that time she has got to play with lots of cool technology, everything from RabbitMQ, to NodeJS and Puppet and
  beyond (as well as the usual suspects of Zend, Zend 2 and Symfony2). Currently she's working with Transform UK at the
  Home Office.
