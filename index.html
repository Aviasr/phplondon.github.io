            <p>Docker is an exciting new project that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere; like a virtual machine on steroids. In this talk I will introduce Docker, why you should be excited about it and show you how it will change your universe!</p>
