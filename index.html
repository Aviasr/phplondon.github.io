            <h3>Chris Levy</h3>
            <h3>The Power of Modern Version Control</h3>
            <p>Version Control Systems have been around for a long time, however in the last decade advancements in VCS and other powerful tools have drastically increased the size of any community that can collaborate with ease. 
In this talk I will focus on the combination of Git and GitHub, demo some advanced tools available in Git, and clarify some details on contributing to Open Source using GitHub.</p>
            <p>Chris has been a PHP Developer for 10 years and has worked with many systems including Symfony2, Zend Framework 1 and 2, and Magento. He currently builds bespoke web applications with ZF1 and ZF2 and is a self-confessed Version Control Zealot.
Chris is an Open Source believer and has made contributions to Open Source.</p>
