    This talk will take you through the Event Sourcing design pattern, then go through how you'd implement it. From
    there we'll move on to CQRS, starting with what it is, then moving onto why it works well with event sourcing and
    how you'd implement it. Finally we'll wrap up with why it's probably not appropriate for most projects, and give
    some examples where it is appropriate.
