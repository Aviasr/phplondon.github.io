    The talk will take us through us an existing legacy stack consisting of Drupal 5, PHP 5.1 and some hodge-podge XML
    "APIs". Then on to how this was migrated to  a modern Service Orientated Architecture with PHP 5.5 and the Slim
    Framework. Finally it will cover a brief introduction to Slim and why to chose a microframework.
