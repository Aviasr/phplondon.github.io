<p>...and when hard is easy. Building great applications in PHP is easy - with frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Yii - it is easier than ever. But the easier you try to make developing applications, the harder it becomes to keep developing one continuously. In my talk I will discuss what easy and hard means at different stages of the project and how we can make it easier for ourselves to deliver software that matters.</p>
