<p>
    Logging is an absolute must for any API or web application, but when starting out, questions such as "how can we do
    it without disrupting everything else" and "what is the easiest way to log" often come up. Weâ€™re going to examine a
    tried and tested method to carry out high-performance, low-latency logging using the power of RabbitMQ to ensure
    minimal impact to the performance of your runtime application. The talk will show you that a really great logging
    architecture is a low-cost investment in your application that will definitely pay off in the long run.
