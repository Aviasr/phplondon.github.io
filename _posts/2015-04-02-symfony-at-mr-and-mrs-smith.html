<p>After spending a childhood glued to an Atari 400, Toby Powell-Blyth read CompSci at Aberystwyth University and jumped straight into writing classic ASP. He soon discovered PHP3, then PHP4, and has never looked back. An illustrious cavalcade of projects followed, from websites about steam pumps (!) to print management solutions and managing a team that built sites such as Links of London, Matches Fashion and Blue Inc.</p>
