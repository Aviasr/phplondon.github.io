<p>
    Version Control Systems have been around for a long time, however in the last decade advancements in VCS and other
    powerful tools have drastically increased the size of any community that can collaborate with ease.
    In this talk I will focus on the combination of Git and GitHub, demo some advanced tools available in Git, and
    clarify some details on contributing to Open Source using GitHub.
