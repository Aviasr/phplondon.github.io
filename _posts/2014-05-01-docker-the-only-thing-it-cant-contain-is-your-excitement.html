<p>
    Docker is an exciting new project that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable,
    self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere; like a virtual machine on steroids. In this talk I will
    introduce Docker, why you should be excited about it and show you how it will change your universe!
