<p>As developers we are asked to implement really challenging and complicated tasks, so it's easy to forget that in reality we need to solve only one problem - transform a Request into a Response. PHP and HTTP are really well suited to this task because of their statelessness, but how can we leverage it and which practises are the best?</p>
<p>During this talk we will take a look into Symfony2 architecture and see how its components are built around Design Patterns that solve problems and fulfil our specific needs.</p>
