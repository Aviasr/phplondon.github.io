<p>Many developers know the pain of setting up a development machine and share the setup with the team - Putting the same folders in the same place, keeping configurations in sync and managing external dependencies. Vagrant solves this problem by creating a development environment inside a virtual machine and making it easy to share with other developers.</p>
<p>Within this talk, I'll take the audience on a trip from a time where everybody would install stuff on localhost until the software starts working to a land where the environment one develops in mirrors the production environment as closely as possible without changing the laptop/pc of the developer. I'll talk about devops and configuration management briefly and show how one can get started with vagrant. After this talk, the audience knows what problems vagrant solves and how to get started.</p>
